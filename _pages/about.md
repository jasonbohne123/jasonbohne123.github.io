Hey, I'm Jason. Currently I am a second year PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics here at Stony Brook University. I'm advised by [Prof. Pawel Polak](https://sites.google.com/view/pawelpolak)  where we work on the intersection of Applied Statistics and Machine Learning to High Frequency Finance. 


More specifically my current research focuses on nonparametric estimation of high freqency financial time series. This leads me to work across a variety of fields including: nonparametric statistics, supervised learning, convex optimization, stochastic calculus, and market microstructure. I am a strong believer in the importance of well-written software in research and utilize Python as my primary language.

For more about my research, please visit my [research page](/research/). While I am not actively working on them, I occasionally upload current writing and development projects to the Writing and Development pages.

To learn more about me, please see my [CV](/cv/).
