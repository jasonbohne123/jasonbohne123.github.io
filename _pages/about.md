Hey, I'm Jason. I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics here at Stony Brook University. I'm advised by [Prof. Pawel Polak](https://sites.google.com/view/pawelpolak)  where we work on the intersection of Applied Statistics and Machine Learning to High Frequency Finance. 

Broadly, the goal of my research is to engineer practical and scalable methods in machine learning that are  well-formulated within statistics and optimization. This leads me to work across a variety of fields including: nonparametric statistics, regression, optimization, algorithm design, statistical learning, and machine learning. At the moment I am working to design robust and efficient learning algorithms for financial time series. For more about my research, please visit my [research page](/research/). 

I strongly believe in open-source software for maximizing the impact of academic research. You can find code  I have written for a variety of current and past projects on my [software page](/software/). I also keep a blog where I write informally about topics that interest me, which you can find [here](/year-archive/). 

Before I joined Stony Brook, I graduated with a B.Sc in Mathematics from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Find my full CV [here](/files/Jason_Bohne_New_CV.pdf).
