Hey, I'm Jason. I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics here at Stony Brook University. I'm advised by [Prof. Pawel Polak](https://sites.google.com/view/pawelpolak)  where we work on the intersection of Applied Statistics and Machine Learning to High Frequency Finance. 

My current research focuses on nonparametric learning in high freqency financial time series. This leads me to work across a variety of fields including: nonparametric statistics and regression, supervised learning, optimization, and algorithm design. The goal of my research is to develop new methods for learning with applications in both quantitative finance and big data. For more about my research, please visit my [research page](/research/). 

I am a strong believer in writing practical and lasting code for research. You can find code  I have written for a variety of current and past projects on my [software page](/software/). I also keep a blog where I write informally about topics that interest me, which you can find [here](/year-archive/). 

Before I joined Stony Brook, I graduated with a B.Sc in Mathematics from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Find my full CV [here](/files/Jason_Bohne_CV.pdf)
