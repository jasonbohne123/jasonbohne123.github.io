### About Me
Hello, Iâ€™m Jason Bohne, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Stony Brook University, advised by Professor [Pawel Polak](https://sites.google.com/view/pawelpolak). Prior to Stony Brook, I completed a B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Chicago from 2018 to 2021, advised by Professor Jie Yang.

My main research interests are (i) **bilevel optimization** (e.g., hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback), and  (ii) **online learning** (e.g., sequential optimization, adversarial learning, and regret minimizing algorithms). Recently I've been interested in the intersection of the aforementioned which is the novel research direction of online bilevel optimization.  

I have been fortunate enough to intern with the Machine Learning Strategy Team in the CTO office at Bloomberg L.P., where  I  study how bilevel optimization and online learning can be applied to a variety of (financial) machine learning tasks.
