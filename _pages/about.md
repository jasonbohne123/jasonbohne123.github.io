Hey, I'm Jason. Currently I am a second year Ph.D. student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics here at Stony Brook University. I'm advised by [Prof. Pawel Polak](https://sites.google.com/view/pawelpolak)  where we work on the intersection of Applied Statistics and Machine Learning to High Frequency Finance. 

More specifically my current research focuses on nonparametric learning in high freqency financial time series. This leads me to work across a variety of fields including: nonparametric statistics and regression, supervised learning, optimization, and algorithm design. The goal of my research is to develop new methods for learning with applications in both quantitative finance and big data.

For more about my research, please visit my [research page](/research/). I keep a blog where I write about my research and other topics that interest me which you can find [here](/writing/). 

I am a strong believer in writing practical and lasting code for research. You can find code  I have written for a variety of past and current projects [here](/software/).

To learn more about me, please see my [CV](/files/Jason_Bohne_CV.pdf)
